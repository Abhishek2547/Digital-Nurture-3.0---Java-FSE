1. Understand Recursive Algorithms
Concept of Recursion:

Definition: Recursion is a method where a function calls itself to solve smaller instances of the same problem. A recursive function typically has two parts:
Base Case: The simplest instance of the problem that can be solved directly without recursion.
Recursive Case: The part of the function where it calls itself with modified parameters to move towards the base case.
Advantages:

Simplicity: Recursive solutions can be more straightforward and easier to understand, especially for problems that can naturally be divided into similar sub-problems (e.g., calculating factorials, Fibonacci series).
Disadvantages:

Overhead: Recursive calls consume stack space and can lead to high memory usage.
Redundant Calculations: Without optimization, recursive algorithms can perform redundant calculations.

2. Analysis
Time Complexity:

The time complexity of the recursive method is O(n), where n is the number of periods. This is because the function makes one recursive call per period.
Optimization:

To optimize the recursive solution and avoid excessive computation, you can use memoization or convert the recursion into an iterative solution.

1. Memoization: Cache results of previous calculations to avoid redundant computations.

Advantages of Iterative Approach:

Efficiency: The iterative approach generally has lower overhead and does not risk stack overflow errors as recursion does.
Better Performance: Iterative solutions often perform better with large inputs due to less overhead compared to recursion.
