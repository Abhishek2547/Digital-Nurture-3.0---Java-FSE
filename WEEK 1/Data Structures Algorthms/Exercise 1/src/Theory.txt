1. Understand the Problem
Importance of Data Structures and Algorithms:

Handling large inventories efficiently requires careful consideration of data structures and algorithms. The primary reasons are:

Scalability: Efficient data structures ensure that the system can handle a growing number of products without significant performance degradation.
Speed: Algorithms and data structures that provide faster search, insertion, and deletion operations are crucial for real-time inventory management.
Resource Utilization: Proper data structures help in optimizing memory usage and computational resources.
Suitable Data Structures:

ArrayList: Provides indexed access and is good for scenarios where the number of products is relatively small or if frequent access to elements by index is needed. However, it can be inefficient for insertions and deletions in the middle of the list due to shifting operations.

HashMap: Offers constant-time average complexity for insertion, deletion, and search operations. It is suitable for scenarios where you need quick access to products by their unique identifiers (e.g., productId).

TreeMap: Maintains a sorted order of keys and provides logarithmic time complexity for operations. It can be useful if you need the inventory to be ordered by some criteria.

For an inventory management system where quick access and updates are crucial, a HashMap is often the most suitable choice.

2. Analysis
Time Complexity Analysis:

Add Operation: O(1) on average due to the HashMap's constant-time complexity for insertions.
Update Operation: O(1) on average, as it involves updating the value for an existing key.
Delete Operation: O(1) on average, as it involves removing the key-value pair.

Optimization:
Hash Function: Ensure that the HashMap's hash function distributes keys evenly to avoid collisions and maintain O(1) complexity.
Load Factor: Adjust the load factor and initial capacity of the HashMap to optimize performance based on the expected size of the inventory.
Concurrency: If the system will be accessed by multiple threads, consider using ConcurrentHashMap to handle concurrency issues efficiently.
