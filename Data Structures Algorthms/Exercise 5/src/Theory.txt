1. Understand Linked Lists
Types of Linked Lists:

Singly Linked List:

Each node contains data and a reference to the next node in the sequence.
Allows for efficient insertion and deletion operations.
Traversing is only possible in one direction (from head to tail).
Doubly Linked List:

Each node contains data, a reference to the next node, and a reference to the previous node.
Allows for efficient insertion and deletion operations in both directions.
Traversing is possible in both forward and backward directions.
Advantages of Linked Lists:

Dynamic Size: Linked lists can easily grow and shrink in size, making them more flexible than arrays which have a fixed size.
Efficient Insertions/Deletions: Insertions and deletions can be performed efficiently without resizing or shifting elements, as long as you have a reference to the correct node.

2. Analysis
Time Complexity Analysis:

Add Operation:

Average Case: O(n) (needs to traverse to the end of the list)
Worst Case: O(n) (same reason as above)
Search Operation:

Best Case: O(1) (if the task is at the head)
Average Case: O(n) (searching through the list)
Worst Case: O(n) (if the task is at the end or not found)
Traverse Operation:

Time Complexity: O(n) (where n is the number of tasks)
Delete Operation:

Best Case: O(1) (if the task is at the head)
Average Case: O(n) (needs to find the task and then update links)
Worst Case: O(n) (same reason as above)
Advantages of Linked Lists over Arrays:

Dynamic Size: Linked lists can grow and shrink dynamically, unlike arrays which have a fixed size.
Efficient Insertions/Deletions: Insertion and deletion operations are more efficient in linked lists as they do not require shifting elements like in arrays. You only need to update node references.
No Wasted Space: Linked lists do not require allocating space for unused elements, which can save memory in cases where the number of elements varies significantly.
